## Kubernetes Deployment

1. Ensure that you have a Kubernetes cluster set up.
2. Ensure that you have kubectl installed and configured to point to your Kubernetes cluster.
3. Set up environemnt variables under the config-map.yaml files and secrets.yaml files in the kubernetes directory. Each service also has its own config-map and secret file. Template files have been provided in the kubernetes directory.
4. Run `kubectl apply -f kubernetes/ --recursive` to deploy all services to your Kubernetes cluster.

## Deploying this project using docker-compose

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Docker installed.
3. (Optional) Sign up for a MongoDB Atlas account
   - The docker compose file is configured to use a local MongoDB instance by default. If you would like to use a remote MongoDB instance, you can follow the instructions in the ["Remote DB Setup"](#remote-db-setup-mongodb-atlas-optional) section below.

## Docker Compose for all services (including frontend)

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project.
2. Duplicate the .env.sample file and rename it to .env
   - If you wish to, you can modify the values in the .env file

## Docker Compose for individual services

If the services are to be run individually (e.g. for deployment on different platforms), you can follow the instructions below.

### Matching Service

1. cd into the matching-service directory
2. Duplicate the .env.sample file and rename it to .env
   - If you wish to, you can modify the values in the .env file

      | **Variable** | **Description** | **Default Value** |
      |--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
      | MATCHING_SERVICE_PORT | Port to run the service | 8002 |
      | USER_SERVICE_URL | URL of the user service | http://localhost:8004 |

      | REDIS_URL | URL of the Redis instance | redis://redis:6379 |
      | MATCHING_SERVICE_LOGS_DIR | Directory to store logs for the matching service | ./logs |
      | MATCHING_TIMEOUT | Timeout for matching in milliseconds | 10000 |

3. Run `docker-compose up` to start the matching service.

### Question Service

1. cd into the question-service directory
2. Duplicate the .env.sample file and rename it to .env
   - If you wish to, you can modify the values in the .env file

      | **Variable** | **Description** | **Default Value** |
      |--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
      |QUESTION_MONGODB_URI  | MongoDB URI     | None, commented out. If you are using a remote MongoDB instance, you can key in your connection string here |
      | QUESTION_PORT         | Port to run the service | 8003 |

**Common Issue and Troubleshooting**

Issue: MongoParseError: URI malformed
- Solution: Ensure that the MONGODB_URI in your .env file is correctly formatted with the right username, password, and database name.


### User Service

1. cd into the user-service directory
2. Duplicate the .env.sample file and rename it to .env
   - If you wish to, modify the values in the .env file to change the port that the service is hosted on.

      | **Variable** | **Description** | **Default Value** |
      |--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
      | USER_MONGODB_URI  | MongoDB URI     | None, commented out. If you are using a remote MongoDB instance, you can key in your connection string here|
      | MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME | MongoDB root username | root |
      | MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD | MongoDB root password | password
      | GMAIL_USER | Gmail account for verification emails | None, you can key in your Gmail account here |

      | JWT_SECRET | Secret for creating JWT signature | you-can-replace-this-with-your-own-secret |
3. Run `docker-compose up` to start the user service.
   - If you keyed in a remote MongoDB URI in the .env file, the MongoDB container will not be started. The user service will connect to the remote MongoDB instance instead.

### Collaboration Service

1. cd into the collab-service directory
2. Duplicate the .env.sample file and rename it to .env
   - If you wish to, you can modify the values in the .env file

      | **Variable** | **Description** | **Default Value** |
      |--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
      | COLLAB_MONGODB_URI | MongoDB URI | None, commented out. If you are using a remote MongoDB instance, you can key in your connection string here |

## Building your own Docker images

1. cd into the any of the service directories (question-service, user-service, frontend/peerprep)
2. Run `docker build -t "<image-name>" .` to build the Docker image.

Alternatively, you can use the `build_and_push_services.sh` or `build_and_push_services_dev.sh` script to build and push all services to the Docker image to Docker Hub.
